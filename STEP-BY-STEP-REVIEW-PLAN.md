# Detailed Step-by-Step Review & Execution Plan

This document provides a comprehensive review and execution plan for each step in the Incremental Implementation Plan, evaluating for:
- ✅ **Completeness**: Does it meet all plan requirements?
- 🏗️ **Engineering Discipline**: Is it well-architected and maintainable?
- ⚠️ **Overengineering**: Are we adding unnecessary complexity?
- 🎯 **Integrity**: Does it actually work as intended?
- 🎭 **Test Theatre**: Are tests meaningful or just for show?

---

## Step 1: Fix Build System and Establish Baseline ✅ COMPLETED

### Review Status
**Current State**: Build system is working, but baseline benchmarks not established.

### Review Findings

#### ✅ Completeness (7/10)
- Build system: ✅ Fixed and working
- Tests passing: ✅ All tests pass
- CLI functional: ✅ Can be built and run
- Baseline benchmarks: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

#### 🏗️ Engineering Discipline (8/10)
- Good monorepo structure maintained from Gemini CLI
- Proper TypeScript configuration
- Clean build scripts

#### ⚠️ Overengineering Risk (Low)
- Appropriately simple - just fixed the build

#### 🎯 Integrity Issues
- **Missing baseline benchmarks** - Critical for measuring improvements
- No benchmark framework exists yet despite documentation

#### 🎭 Test Theatre Check
- Existing tests from Gemini CLI are comprehensive
- No test theatre detected

### Required Actions
1. **Create benchmark framework** (packages/core/src/benchmarking/)
2. **Define 5 baseline coding tasks**
3. **Run and record baseline metrics**
4. **Create benchmark results storage**

## Step 2: Add Project Type Detection 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/projectTypeDetector.ts
- [ ] Create ProjectTypeDetector class
- [ ] Implement package.json parsing
- [ ] Add framework detection logic
- [ ] Handle edge cases (multiple frameworks, no package.json)
- [ ] Add caching to avoid repeated file reads
```

#### Integration Points
```typescript
// packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts
- [ ] Modify system prompt generation
- [ ] Add "This is a [React/Vue/Angular] project" context
- [ ] Ensure context is minimal and focused
```

#### Test Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for each framework detection
- [ ] Edge cases: monorepos, multiple frameworks, missing files
- [ ] Performance tests (<100ms detection time)
- [ ] Integration test with actual CLI prompts

#### 🎭 Test Theatre Prevention
- Tests must use real project structures, not mocked
- Verify detection works with actual npm/yarn workspaces
- Test with corrupted/incomplete package.json files

#### ⚠️ Overengineering Risks
- Don't detect every possible framework
- Start with React, Vue, Angular, Next.js only
- Don't parse entire dependency tree
- Simple string matching is sufficient

#### Success Metrics
- Detection accuracy: >95% on test projects
- Performance: <100ms added to startup
- Quality improvement: >10% on framework-specific tasks

---

## Step 3: Add Build Tool Detection 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
```typescript
// Extend ProjectTypeDetector
- [ ] Add buildTool detection to existing class
- [ ] Check for webpack.config.js, vite.config.js, etc.
- [ ] Parse package.json scripts for build commands
- [ ] Return structured ProjectContext object
```

#### 🎭 Test Theatre Prevention
- Test with real build configurations
- Verify detection with custom/unusual setups
- Test build tool version detection

#### ⚠️ Overengineering Risks
- Don't parse build configs deeply
- Just identify the tool, not its configuration
- Avoid complex heuristics

---

## Step 4: Add Recent Files Context 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/recentFilesDetector.ts
- [ ] Create RecentFilesDetector class
- [ ] Use git to find recently modified files
- [ ] Implement smart filtering (no node_modules, dist, etc.)
- [ ] Add configurable count limit
- [ ] Handle non-git projects gracefully
```

#### 🎯 Integrity Checks
- Must work in non-git directories
- Should respect .gitignore patterns
- Performance must scale with large repos

#### 🎭 Test Theatre Prevention
- Test with actual large repositories
- Verify performance with 100k+ file projects
- Test git command failures/edge cases

---

## Step 5: Build Context7 CLI Wrapper 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Architecture Decision
**Choose between**:
1. Node.js wrapper calling Context7 API
2. Standalone binary using the API
3. Direct MCP integration

#### Implementation Checklist
```typescript
// packages/core/src/tools/context7Wrapper.ts
- [ ] Create Context7 API client
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create CLI interface
- [ ] Package as executable
```

#### 🎯 Integrity Requirements
- Must handle API downtime gracefully
- Should cache responses appropriately
- Must respect rate limits

#### ⚠️ Overengineering Risks
- Start with simple HTTP client
- Don't build complex queue system initially
- Basic caching is sufficient

---

## Step 6: Integrate Context7 with File Mentions 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add file mention detection to prompts
- [ ] Integrate Context7 wrapper
- [ ] Implement timeout handling
- [ ] Add context size limits

#### 🎭 Test Theatre Prevention
- Test with actual API responses
- Verify timeout behavior
- Test with rate-limited scenarios

---

## Step 7: Add Project Pattern Recognition 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Extend context to general project questions
- [ ] Map project types to documentation
- [ ] Implement smart context selection

#### ⚠️ Overengineering Risks
- Don't try to understand entire codebase
- Focus on common patterns only
- Keep context focused and relevant

---

## Step 8: Add Conversation Memory 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/conversationMemory.ts
- [ ] Create ConversationMemory class
- [ ] Track provided context per turn
- [ ] Implement context deduplication
- [ ] Add memory size limits
```

#### 🎯 Integrity Checks
- Memory must persist across conversation
- Should handle memory overflow gracefully
- Must maintain conversation coherence

---

## Step 9: Create Intelligent Request Router 🔄 TO EXECUTE

### Execution Plan

#### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Build request classification system
- [ ] Route to appropriate context gatherers
