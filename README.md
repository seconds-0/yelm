# Yelm Project

## Overview
This is the main repository for the Yelm project, a Frankenstein base inspired by components from three open-source projects. We're using them purely for reference and inspiration, writing original code in `yelm-core/`.

## Structure
- **yelm-core/**: Core codebase where we'll build our implementation.
- **references/**: Cloned OSS projects for inspiration (ignored by git; not committed).
- **Documentation/**: Project docs, including References.md for inspiration notes and Plans/ for workplans.
