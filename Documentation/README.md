# Yelm Documentation

## Project Overview

Yelm is an advanced CLI-based coding assistant that extends Gemini-CLI with sophisticated context management capabilities. The core premise is that coding agents are already amazing but need the right context at the right time to thrive.

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Requirements](specs/requirements.md) to understand the project vision
2. Check [Implementation Status](../IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) for current progress
3. Follow the [Incremental Implementation Plan](INCREMENTAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md) for step-by-step development
4. Follow [Development Standards](steering/yelm-development-standards.md) for contributing

## Key Concepts

### V1 MVP Focus
- Fork and extend Gemini CLI
- Add Context7 integration for documentation lookup
- Implement project structure analysis
- Create benchmarking framework
- Maintain <100ms CLI response times

### Future Versions
- V2: Multi-model support and enhanced reliability
- V3: Rules generation and memory system
- V4+: Advanced features like adversarial verification and temporal context

## Current Status

The project has successfully forked Gemini CLI and created the foundation, but core context management features are not yet implemented. See [Implementation Status](../IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md) for details.
