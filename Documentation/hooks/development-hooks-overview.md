# Development Hooks Overview

This document describes the quality assurance hooks that were originally designed for the Yelm project. While we're not using the Kiro system anymore, these concepts can be valuable for maintaining code quality through other means (CI/CD, code reviews, etc.).

## Pre-Delivery Critical Review

**Purpose**: Force critical self-analysis before declaring any task complete.

**Key Questions**:
- Does this actually solve the user's problem?
- Is the implementation production-ready?
- Have all edge cases been considered?
- Is the code maintainable and well-documented?

## Delivery Validation

**Purpose**: Verify that deliverables match the original requirements.

**Validation Steps**:
1. List all promised deliverables
2. Check each deliverable exists and works
3. Verify no regression in existing functionality
4. Ensure documentation is updated

## Code Quality Review

**Purpose**: Automatic review of code changes for quality standards.

**Review Areas**:
- TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- Performance considerations
- Security implications
- Code maintainability
- Test coverage

## Adversarial Plan Review

**Purpose**: Multi-perspective review of solutions before implementation.

**Perspectives**:
- **Optimizer**: Is this the most efficient solution?
- **Security Auditor**: Are there security vulnerabilities?
- **Maintainability Critic**: Will this be maintainable long-term?
- **User Advocate**: Does this provide good user experience?

## Test Execution

**Purpose**: Intelligent test execution based on code changes.

**Considerations**:
- Run relevant tests based on changed files
- Verify coverage thresholds are met
- Check for performance regressions
- Ensure no breaking changes

## Integration with Development Workflow

While these were originally Kiro hooks, the concepts can be integrated into:

1. **Pull Request Templates**: Include checklists based on these reviews
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate quality checks
3. **Code Review Process**: Use as guidelines for reviewers
4. **Development Checklists**: Personal quality assurance
