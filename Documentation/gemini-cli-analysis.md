### Technology Stack

**Core Technologies:**
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict configuration
- **Runtime**: Node.js >=20.0.0 (modern ES modules)
- **UI Framework**: React + Ink (sophisticated terminal UI)
- **CLI Framework**: yargs for command parsing
- **Build System**: esbuild for fast bundling
- **Testing**: vitest with coverage
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: Prettier

**Key Dependencies:**
- **HTTP Client**: gaxios (Google's axios wrapper)
- **Terminal UI**: ink, ink-spinner, ink-select-input
- **File Operations**: glob, mime-types
- **Process Management**: shell-quote
- **Configuration**: dotenv, strip-json-comments

### Architecture Patterns

**Monorepo Structure:**
- Uses npm workspaces for package management
- Clear separation between CLI interface and core logic
- Shared build and testing infrastructure

**Modern Node.js:**
- ES modules throughout (`"type": "module"`)
- Top-level await support
- Modern async/await patterns

**Professional Build Pipeline:**
- esbuild for fast compilation and bundling
- Comprehensive linting and formatting
- Automated testing with coverage
- Docker support for sandboxed execution

## Integration Strategy for Yelm

### Recommended Approach: Extend React/Ink Foundation

**Why Extend Instead of Replace:**
1. **Baseline Compatibility**: Direct compatibility with their UI improvements
2. **Proven Architecture**: Their React/Ink system is sophisticated and battle-tested
3. **Professional Experience**: Users expect the sophisticated Gemini CLI experience
4. **Maintenance**: Easier to pull their UI improvements and updates

**Extension Strategy:**
1. Use their React/Ink foundation as our base UI system
2. Extend their AppWrapper component with context management features
3. Add our commands to their existing command structure
4. Leverage their theming, spinners, and UI components
5. Replace Google-specific services with our implementations

### Technical Integration Points

**Command Structure:**
- Extend their yargs-based command parsing
- Add new commands for context management
- Preserve existing Gemini functionality

**Configuration System:**
- Extend their dotenv-based configuration
- Add Yelm-specific config in `.yelm/` directory
- Maintain compatibility with their existing config

**UI Framework:**
- Leverage their React/Ink terminal UI system
- Add context-aware UI components
- Maintain their sophisticated user experience

**Build System:**
- Use their esbuild configuration as base
- Extend build process for our additional components
- Maintain their bundling and distribution approach

## Context Management Integration

### Conversation History
**Their Approach**: Likely uses terminal history and session state
**Our Extension**: Add persistent conversation storage in `.yelm/` directory

### Project Analysis
**Their Approach**: Basic file system operations with glob
**Our Extension**: Deep project structure analysis with caching

### Documentation Context
**Their Approach**: Limited context awareness
**Our Extension**: Context7 integration with intelligent caching

## Performance Considerations

### Their Performance Profile
- Fast startup with esbuild bundling
- Efficient React/Ink rendering
- Optimized for terminal responsiveness

### Our Performance Targets
- Maintain their <100ms CLI response time
- Add context operations with aggressive caching
- Ensure context loading doesn't block core functionality

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >=20.0.0
- npm for package management
- TypeScript for development
- Docker for sandboxed execution (optional)

### Build Process
```bash
npm ci                 # Install dependencies
npm run build         # Build all packages
npm run test          # Run test suite
npm run lint          # Check code quality
npm run bundle        # Create distribution bundle
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
npm run start         # Start development version
npm run debug         # Start with debugger
npm run test:ci       # Run CI tests
npm run typecheck     # Type checking
```

## Security and Configuration

### API Key Management
- Uses environment variables and dotenv
- Supports both Google OAuth and API key authentication
- Secure credential storage patterns

### Sandboxing
- Docker-based sandboxed execution for code operations
- Configurable sandbox images
- Security-first approach to code execution

## Testing Strategy

### Their Testing Approach
- Unit tests with vitest
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Coverage reporting with @vitest/coverage-v8
- React component testing with @testing-library/react

### Our Testing Extensions
- Extend their vitest configuration
- Add Context7 integration tests
- Performance regression tests
- Context management unit tests

## Deployment and Distribution

### Their Distribution
- npm package: `@google/gemini-cli`
- Binary: `gemini` command
- Bundle-based distribution with esbuild

### Our Distribution Strategy
- Fork their npm package approach
- Maintain `yelm` command name
- Independent versioning and releases

## Key Takeaways for Yelm Development

1. **Sophisticated Architecture**: They use professional-grade tooling and patterns
2. **React/Ink UI**: Rich terminal interface, not simple CLI
3. **Modern Node.js**: ES modules, async/await, Node 20+
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with modern tools
5. **Professional Build**: esbuild, linting, formatting, bundling
6. **Security Focus**: Sandboxing and secure credential management

## Integration Complexity Assessment

**Low Complexity:**
- Command extension with yargs
- Configuration extension
- Build system reuse

**Medium Complexity:**
- React/Ink UI integration
- Context management integration
- Testing framework extension

**High Complexity:**
- Deep core functionality modifications
- Sandboxing integration
- Performance optimization

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fork Repository**: Create independent fork for Yelm development
2. **Environment Setup**: Match their development environment exactly
3. **Build Verification**: Ensure we can build and run their code
4. **Extension Planning**: Design our context management integration points
5. **Testing Setup**: Extend their testing framework for our components

This analysis provides the foundation for our Yelm Coding Agent development, ensuring we build on their solid architecture while maintaining independence and adding our context management capabilities.
