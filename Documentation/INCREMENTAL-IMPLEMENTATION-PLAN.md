# Incremental Implementation Plan

## Development Philosophy

Each step follows this cycle:
1. **Implement** - Single, focused feature
2. **Test** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Benchmark** - Measure improvement over previous step
4. **Evaluate** - Does this feature provide measurable value?
5. **Tweak** - Optimize based on benchmarking results
6. **Document** - Record learnings and move to next step

## Step 1: Fix Build System and Establish Baseline

### Goal
Get the CLI building and establish baseline performance metrics.

### Implementation
- Analyze and fix the TypeScript circular dependency issue
- Get `npm run build` working for both packages
- Ensure React/Ink UI is accessible

### Testing
- All existing tests pass
- CLI can be built and run
- Basic commands work (help, version, simple prompts)

### Benchmarking
- Measure baseline Gemini CLI performance on 5 simple coding tasks
- Record response time, quality, and user satisfaction
- This becomes our comparison point for all future improvements

### Success Criteria
- Build completes without errors
- CLI responds to prompts within 2 seconds
- Baseline benchmark scores recorded

### Deliverable
Working Yelm CLI that's identical to Gemini CLI in functionality

## Step 2: Add Project Type Detection

### Goal
Detect if the current project is React, Vue, Angular, etc. and include this in prompts.

### Implementation
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/projectTypeDetector.ts
export class ProjectTypeDetector {
  async detectProjectType(projectPath: string): Promise<ProjectType | null> {
    // Check package.json for framework dependencies
    // Return 'react', 'vue', 'angular', or null
  }
}
```

### Integration
- Modify prompt to include: "This is a React project" when React is detected
- Only add this context, nothing else

### Testing
- Unit tests for all framework detection logic
- Integration tests with sample projects
- Edge case testing (multiple frameworks, no framework)

### Benchmarking
- Run same 5 coding tasks with and without project type context
- Measure improvement in response quality
- Focus on framework-specific suggestions

### Success Criteria
- >10% improvement in response quality when project type is known
- No performance degradation (<100ms added to response time)
- Correct detection in >95% of test cases

### Deliverable
CLI that says "This is a React project" in prompts when appropriate

---

## Step 3: Add Build Tool Detection

### Goal
Detect build tools (webpack, vite, esbuild, etc.) and include in context.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Extend ProjectTypeDetector to include build tools
export interface ProjectContext {
  framework: string | null;
  buildTool: string | null;
}
```

### Integration
- Add build tool info to prompts: "Uses Vite for building"
- Still keep context minimal and focused

### Testing
- Unit tests for build tool detection
- Integration tests with various project setups
- Performance tests to ensure no slowdown

### Benchmarking
- Compare responses with framework-only vs framework+buildtool context
- Measure improvement in build-related suggestions
- Track any performance impact

### Success Criteria
- Additional >5% improvement in response quality
- Build tool correctly detected in >90% of cases
- Context gathering still <100ms

### Deliverable
CLI that includes both project type and build tool in context

---

## Step 4: Add Recent Files Context

### Goal
Include recently modified files in the project context.

### Implementation
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/recentFilesDetector.ts
export class RecentFilesDetector {
  async getRecentFiles(projectPath: string, count = 5): Promise<string[]> {
    // Get 5 most recently modified files
    // Filter out node_modules, dist, etc.
  }
}
```

### Integration
- Add to prompt: "Recently modified files: src/App.tsx, src/components/Button.tsx"
- Keep file list short (5 files max)

### Testing
- Unit tests for file discovery and filtering
- Integration tests with different project structures
- Performance tests for large repositories

### Benchmarking
- Test with coding tasks that relate to existing files
- Measure improvement in contextual suggestions
- Track file discovery performance

### Success Criteria
- >10% improvement in tasks involving existing files
- File discovery completes in <50ms
- Correctly filters out irrelevant files

### Deliverable
CLI that includes recent files in context

---

## Step 5: Build Context7 CLI Wrapper

### Goal
Create a CLI wrapper around Context7 API for documentation lookup.

### Implementation
```typescript
// packages/core/src/tools/context7Wrapper.ts
export class Context7Wrapper {
  async createCLIWrapper(): Promise<string> {
    // Create executable that wraps Context7 API
    // Return path to the wrapper executable
  }
}
```

### Integration
- Don't integrate with main CLI yet
- Create standalone tool that can be tested independently

### Testing
- Unit tests for API wrapper functionality
- Integration tests with Context7 API
- Error handling tests (API down, timeout, etc.)

### Benchmarking
- Test wrapper response time vs direct API calls
- Measure reliability and error rates
- Document API rate limits and behavior

### Success Criteria
- Wrapper executes successfully and returns results
- Response time <3 seconds for typical queries
- Error rate <5% under normal conditions

### Deliverable
Standalone `context7-cli` executable that wraps the API

---

## Step 6: Add Documentation Context (Single File)

### Goal
When user asks about a specific file, look up relevant documentation.

### Implementation
```typescript
// Only trigger on prompts that mention specific files
// "How do I modify src/App.tsx?" -> look up React documentation
```

### Integration
- Use Context7 CLI wrapper from Step 5
- Only add documentation context if file is mentioned in prompt
- Limit to 1 documentation source to avoid overwhelming context

### Testing
- Unit tests for file mention detection
- Integration tests with Context7 CLI wrapper
- Performance tests with documentation lookup

### Benchmarking
- Test with file-specific questions vs general questions
- Measure improvement in accuracy when documentation is available
- Track Context7 response times and reliability

### Success Criteria
- >20% improvement in file-specific questions
- Documentation lookup completes in <3 seconds
- Graceful degradation when Context7 unavailable

### Deliverable
CLI that adds relevant documentation when specific files are mentioned

---

## Step 7: Expand Documentation Context (Project-wide)

### Goal
Add relevant documentation for general project questions.

### Implementation
```typescript
// For general prompts, look up documentation based on project type
// "How do I add a new component?" -> look up React component docs
```

### Integration
- Use project type from Step 2 to determine relevant documentation
- Add project-wide documentation context
- Still limit to prevent context overload

### Testing
- Unit tests for project-type to documentation mapping
- Integration tests with various project types
- Performance tests for documentation gathering

### Benchmarking
- Compare general questions with and without project documentation
- Measure improvement in project-specific suggestions
- Track context gathering performance

### Success Criteria
- >15% improvement in general project questions
- Documentation relevant to project type in >80% of cases
- Total context gathering <5 seconds

### Deliverable
CLI that adds project-relevant documentation for general questions

---

## Step 8: Add Conversation Memory

### Goal
Remember context from earlier in the conversation to avoid redundant lookups.

### Implementation
```typescript
// packages/core/src/context/conversationMemory.ts
export class ConversationMemory {
  // Store what context was provided in each turn
  // Avoid re-adding same context repeatedly
}
```

### Integration
- Track what context was provided in previous turns
- Skip redundant context gathering
- Maintain conversation coherence

### Testing
- Unit tests for memory storage and retrieval
- Integration tests with multi-turn conversations
- Performance tests for memory operations

### Benchmarking
- Compare multi-turn conversations with and without memory
- Measure improvement in conversation coherence
- Track memory usage and performance

### Success Criteria
- >10% improvement in multi-turn conversation quality
- Memory operations add <10ms to response time
- Conversation context stays relevant across turns

### Deliverable
CLI that remembers context across conversation turns

---

## Step 9: Add Context Caching

### Goal
Cache context lookups to improve performance on repeated queries.

### Implementation

export class ContextCache {
  // Cache project analysis, documentation lookups, etc.
  // Use SQLite for persistence
}
```

### Integration
- Cache project analysis results
- Cache documentation lookups
- Cache with appropriate TTL

### Testing

## Documentation Requirements

After each step, update:
- IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md with current progress
- Benchmarking results and analysis
- Any lessons learned or architecture changes
- Next step planning based on results

This approach ensures we're building valuable features incrementally and can pivot quickly if a feature doesn't provide the expected value.
