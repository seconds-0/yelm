# Inspiration References

This file tracks the open-source projects we're using for inspiration. Add entries as we incorporate references. Remember: We're not copying codeâ€”only using for ideas and patterns.

|---------|------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| (e.g., Project1) | https://github.com/org/project1 | /src/components/Foo.tsx, /lib/utils/bar.ts | Great auth flow patterns |
