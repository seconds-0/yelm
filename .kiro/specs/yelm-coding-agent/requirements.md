# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Yelm Coding Agent is an advanced CLI-based coding assistant that extends the Gemini-CLI foundation with sophisticated context management capabilities. The primary goal is to provide coding agents with the right context at the right time, dramatically improving their effectiveness through intelligent context expansion, documentation integration, automated rules generation, adversarial verification, temporal context understanding, and comprehensive performance benchmarking.

The project is structured in multiple phases to allow for incremental development and rigorous testing at each stage. The core premise is that coding agents are already amazing but need the right context at the right time to thrive, incorporating concepts from Kiro's specs/planning, Cursor's UX, Claude's features, and other leading tools.

## Version Roadmap

- **V1 (MVP)**: Core CLI foundation + Context7 integration + Basic benchmarking
- **V2**: Automatic rules generation + Memory system + Enhanced planning
- **V3**: Adversarial verification + Temporal context + Advanced review cycles
- **V4**: Continuous goal checking + Offramps + Advanced memory management
